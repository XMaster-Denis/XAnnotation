# Image Annotation Tool for Neural Network Training

This is a macOS application for annotating images to prepare datasets for object recognition neural networks. The tool is designed to simplify the creation of datasets in the CreateML-compatible format, enabling you to train, test, and validate machine learning models.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Project Management
- **Create a New Project:** Start a new annotation project by selecting a folder and naming the project.
- **Open Existing Projects:** Easily resume work on saved projects.

### Image Import and Organization
- **Add Folders with Images:** Import multiple folders containing images for annotation.
- **Folder View:** Navigate through folders and switch between groups of images effortlessly.
- **Image Previews:** View thumbnails of all images in the selected folder with annotation counters.

### Annotation and Classification
- **Add Classes:** Define object classes by entering their names and assigning unique colors.
- **Annotate Objects:** Use the mouse to draw bounding boxes around objects in images.
- **Class Management:**
  - Rename classes using the context menu.
  - Delete classes if no longer needed.
  - Change class colors for easier distinction.
- **Adjust Annotations:** Resize and reposition bounding boxes with anchor points on the corners.

### Multi-Language Support
- **Languages Available:**
  - English
  - German
  - Russian
- Switch languages through the `Settings > Languages` menu.

### Advanced Tools
- **Export for CreateML:** Split annotated data into three folders for training, testing, and validation:
  - Default proportions: `70% training`, `15% testing`, `15% validation`.
  - Modify proportions through `Settings > Export Proportions`.
  - Export includes annotated images and JSON files compatible with CreateML.
- **Image Rotation:** Enable `Rotate Output Images` to augment data by generating rotated versions (90Â°, 180Â°, 270Â°).
- **Clear Annotations:** Use the `Remove Annotations from Image` button to reset annotations on a specific image.

### Hotkeys for Navigation
- **Q:** Navigate to the previous image.
- **W:** Navigate to the next image.

### Logging
- **Activity Log:** Monitor all actions in a log window for reference and debugging.
